        <h3><B>Types Of Environmental Pollution:</B></h3>
        <P>Environmental pollution refers to the contamination of the natural environment by harmful substances or
            pollutants. <br>There are several types of pollution:<br>
            <br><b>Air Pollution:</b> Caused by the release of harmful gases and particles into the atmosphere from
            vehicles, factories, and burning fossil fuels, leading to health problems and climate change.
            <br><b>Water Pollution:</b> Occurs when chemicals, waste, or toxins are dumped into water bodies,
            contaminating drinking water and affecting aquatic ecosystems.
            <br><b>Soil Pollution:</b> Caused by the improper disposal of hazardous waste, pesticides, and chemicals,
            which degrade soil quality and harm plant life.
            <br><b>Noise Pollution:</b> Excessive noise from industrial activities, traffic, and construction can lead
            to hearing loss and stress-related illnesses.
            <br><b>Light Pollution:</b> Over-illumination in urban areas disrupts ecosystems and human sleep cycles.
            <br><b>Thermal Pollution:</b> When industries release excess heat into water bodies, it raises water
            temperature, harming aquatic life.
            <br><b>Radioactive Pollution:</b> Emitted from nuclear plants or weapons testing, radiation can cause severe
            health risks like cancer.
            Each type negatively impacts the environment and human health.
        </p>

        <h3><b>Health Effects Of Pollution:</b></h3>
        <p>Pollution has numerous harmful effects on human health, depending on the type of exposure:

            <br><br><b>Air Pollution:</b> Causes respiratory problems like asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer.
            Prolonged exposure to polluted air can also lead to cardiovascular diseases.
            <br><b>Water Pollution:</b> Contaminated water can spread diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and lead
            poisoning. It affects vital organs like the liver and kidneys.
            <br><b>Soil Pollution:</b> Toxins from polluted soil can enter the food chain, causing health issues like
            cancer, birth defects, and skin diseases.
            <br><b>Noise Pollution:</b> Constant exposure to loud noise can lead to hearing loss, high blood pressure,
            and stress-related illnesses like anxiety.
            <br><b>Light Pollution:</b> Disrupts sleep cycles (circadian rhythms), leading to insomnia and increased
            risk of depression.
            <br><b>Thermal Pollution:</b> Alters local climates, indirectly affecting human health through increased
            heat stress and reduced air quality.
            <br><b>Radioactive Pollution:</b> Prolonged exposure to radiation causes serious health conditions like
            cancer, genetic mutations, and acute radiation syndrome.
            Each form of pollution poses significant risks to human well-being and longevity.

        <h3><b>Ecological and Economic Impacts of Pollution:</b></h3>
        <p>Pollution has both ecological and economic impacts that affect ecosystems and human activities.<br>
            <br><b>Ecological Impacts:</b>
            <br><b>Air Pollution:</b> Damages plant life, reduces biodiversity, and contributes to global warming, which
            affects natural habitats and wildlife survival.
            <br><b>Water Pollution:</b> Harms aquatic ecosystems by reducing oxygen levels, killing fish, and disrupting
            food chains. Contaminated water also damages wetlands and marine environments.
            <br><b>Soil Pollution:</b> Reduces soil fertility, affecting plant growth and leading to the loss of arable
            land, which impacts food production and ecosystems.
            <br><b>Noise Pollution:</b> Disrupts animal communication and breeding patterns, leading to imbalances in
            ecosystems.
            <br><b>Light Pollution:</b> Affects nocturnal wildlife by altering natural behaviors like hunting and
            migration.
            <br><br><b>Economic Impacts:</b>
            <br><b>Healthcare Costs:</b> Pollution leads to increased healthcare costs due to diseases and health
            problems.
            <br><b>Agricultural Losses:</b> Reduces agricultural yields, impacting food security and livelihoods.
            <br><b>Tourism Loss:</b> Polluted environments deter tourism, causing economic loss in areas that rely on
            natural beauty and biodiversity.
            <br><b>Industrial Clean-up Costs:</b> Governments and businesses incur heavy expenses to clean up polluted
            areas and restore ecosystems.
            <br>These impacts lead to long-term damage to both nature and economies.
